# swift.js
 
 **This is not the programming language, Swift.**

Swift.js (or Swifting.js for the package name) is a entertaining npm package for absolutely nothing use. Use can use this package for your discord bot fun command and just name the command to /swift or anything. 

## What is Swift.js for?

Swift.js, is basically a Swift() function, for swifting your string into something funny like:  
`<String> swifted`  
More features will definitely be released when I'm not lazy. Anyone wanna join the Swift.js team please?

## Why is Swift.js

Okay now we have already know what the Swift.js for, but WHY??? WHY SWIFT.JS???  
Then we are going to talk about the history of, **Swift.js**.  
    
My legal first name is Taylor. Since I was a kid, my parents, my grandparents, my friends and my cousins have me a nickname,  
which is Taylor Swift.  
Ok don't ask me why. Like on mid 2021, I was in a programming sevrer, I changed my server nickname to something like `Taylor.Swift()` because I was bored. There was some people noticed my nickname a someone actually asked if that is a function. Okay so I was like, why not I just make a package for that thing.  
  
And this is how, Swift.js is created.  

## Installation 

`npm install swifting.js@latest`

## Usage Example
```js
const Swifts = require("swifting.js");
const Taylor = new Swifts("Taylor");

console.log("Taylor.Swift()");
```
**Expected output:**
`Taylor sweefed`

## [Discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js) Support Example

The example will be updated soon, this will only support on [Discord.js v13](https://discordjs.guide/) because I'm lazy to study [Discord.js v14](https://discordjs.guide/additional-info/changes-in-v14.html#before-you-start).  
Well the Discord.js example is basically same thing as printing the `Taylor.Swift()`. If you have brain, you should know how to do it.

## Sweefed?? I thought its gonna be Swifted?

Well it's just a joke, it will be updated on next update.
